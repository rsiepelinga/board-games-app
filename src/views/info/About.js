      About Us.
    </h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to Table Talk, the brainchild of two avid board gamers and
      software engineers, Rachel and Garrett. We first crossed path during our college years, where a shared passion for board games brought us together. We spent countless hours engrossed in tabletop adventures, discovering new games, and immersing ourselves in the magic of strategic gameplay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Driven by our love for both coding and gaming, we embarked on a mission to create an app that fulfilled our desires. Table Talk became the manifestation of our vision: a virtual hub where you can effortlessly store and track the board games you own, share ratings and reviews, curate your favorites, and even find the perfect game for those moments when indecision strikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      We wanted to create an app that seamlessly integrated with the board game community, providing reliable and up-to-date information. That&apos;s why we integrated data directly from Board Game Geek, a reputable platform known for its extensive collection of board game information, ratings, and reviews. By leveraging this invaluable resource, we ensure that the data you access through Table Talk is reliable and reflective of the larger board gaming community.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of our favorite features of Table Talk is the ability to add personal ratings and keep track of favorites. By curating your own list of top-rated games and marking your favorites, you&apos;ll always have a handy reference for future game nights. And for those times when decisions seem impossible, our app&apos;s ingenious board game selector will come to the rescue, recommending the perfect game based on your preferences and group size.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that board games have a unique power to bring people together, fostering meaningful connections and creating lasting memories. Join us on this exciting journey as we continue to enhance and expand Table Talk&apos;s features. Our mission is to make your tabletop gaming experiences seamless, enjoyable, and memorable. We hope our app becomes your go-to companion, sparking new adventures and strengthening the bonds forged around the gaming table.
