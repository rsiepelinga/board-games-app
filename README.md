# Getting Started with Table Talk App

## Starting Your Local Dev Environment

In the project directory, you can run:

### `node server/index.js`

Runs the server in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in your browser.

Paths:\
`/api/collection/:username`\
`/api/boardgame/:id`

The page will not automatically reload when you make changes.\
To make changes you will need to kill the server and then restart.\

In a separate terminal in your project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Server Files

- **server**
  - **models**: This folder stores all the models for how data will be formatted once it's returned from the server.
    - **Collection.js**: Stores an array of board games (Game).
    - **Game.js**: Stores all the key fields about an individual board game.
  - **routes/api**: These are the paths and where the code that makes the call outs to BGG lives
    - **boardgame.js**: Uses "getGame" to retrieve a singular board game by id from BGG
    - **collection.js**: Uses "getCollection" to get all the board games in each user(s) collection.
  - **index.js**: Stores all the paths to everything referenced in the server folder.

# React App Documentation

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
